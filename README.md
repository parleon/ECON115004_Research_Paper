# ECON115004_Research_Paper

Written freshman year for my stats class with [Nikul Patel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikul-patel-42b149206/). While nothing of significance was found, the project was a great learning experience through our use of Pandas, Numpy, Plotly, and statsmodels.api to do statistical analysis.
